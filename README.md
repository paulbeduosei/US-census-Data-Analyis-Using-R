Exploring US Census Data with R: From State-Level Insights to Local Tract Analysis

Over the past weeks, I dived deep into the US Census and American Community Survey (ACS) data using R, combining packages like tidycensus, tigris, sf, and ggplot2 for reproducible and geospatial analysis.

Here’s what I did:

Pulled median household income, population, and race demographics across states, counties, and Census tracts.

Leveraged 1-year and 5-year ACS datasets to analyze trends over time and across geographies.

Applied data wrangling and visualization techniques, including error bars, scatter plots, and choropleth maps to highlight disparities and patterns.

Integrated geospatial boundaries to map housing values, school district incomes, and population distributions in counties like Travis (TX), Marin (CA), and Washington (WA).

Generated percentage shares and dot density maps for racial composition at tract-level in DC, providing a granular view of demographics.

Key insights & applications:

Revealed income and housing disparities across regions, useful for policy planning and urban research.

Highlighted local demographic trends, supporting targeted social programs or business strategy.

Demonstrated how government datasets can drive data-driven decision making, research, and visualization.

This project strengthened my expertise in census APIs, geospatial analytics, and R-based data storytelling, showing how open data can turn into actionable insights.
